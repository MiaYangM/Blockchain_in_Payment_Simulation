Exploring Blochchain uas in Payment: illustrates a simple account-based payment flow with a mempool, nonce checks, and signature verification (mock).

# Minimal payment example (account-based ledger) for presentation/demo
# - Simple in-memory ledger with accounts and balances
# - Transactions are created, 'signed' (mock), and applied after verification
# - Use this to illustrate on-chain payments, double-spend checks, and mempool processing
#
# Run: python3 payment_example.py
